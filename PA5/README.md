#Sanil Rao Dan Shapiro
#all files are in the PA3 directory within PA4 but the code has been modified for PA4
#We completed all parts of the assignment with no errors in our internal testing 
#All testing files are in TestCasesMeggy directory and all the symboltable code is in src. 
#We updated the mj.cup file as well as the driver code.
#Descriptions for Testcases are in the testcase java files themselves. We tested doubly defined methods and incorrect types for the not working test cases. 
# We were unable to provide videos at the time of submission but can provide them at a later date after the break. Development was done on a linux environment so the Makefile had to be changed but should work on mac.

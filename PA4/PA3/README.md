#We completed all parts of the assignment with no errors in our internal testing #All testing files are in TestCases Meggy directory and all the visitor code is in src. We updated the mj.cup file and added the AVRvisitor file as well.# Videos are in folder called videos within PA3. Development was done on a linux environment so the Makefile had to be changed but should work on mac.
